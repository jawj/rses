*Really Simple Echo Server*

As the title says, this code implements a really simple TCP echo server running on ports 3000 for listen and
3001 for listen.  Written in Node.js in about 10 minutes

* To Run
node echoserver.js

* Add your IP Address to the allow list
echo "127.0.0.1" >> iplist

* To Test
Open 2 terminal windows, use nc to connect to the ports:
nc localhost 3000
nc localhost 3001

What you type in window 1 wil be written out on terminal 2

Enjoy everyone :)
